Fucking about with Spray
========================
Figure out how to Spray


I should be able to
-------------------

 * Run the project with scala 2.10.3 or 2.11-rcwhateverthefuckweareupto
 * Run the project using sbt 0.12.4 (This the latest?)
 * Run the app with `sbt run` or `run` on the sbt command line
 * Run the app using spray/sbt-revolver (`sbt re-start`?)
 * Not have any pom.xml at all
 * Load the sbt file into IDEA without a hassle, or a documented hassle
 * Run the Scala repl in IDEA with the project classpath from sbt
 * Either run sbt-revolver in IDEA, or run sbt directly without too many hacks (IE, CLI -> SBT -> sbt-resolver == bad)
 * Incorporate findbugs and other things into my project


Things I've actually acheived so far
------------------------------------
